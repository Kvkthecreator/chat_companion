*It''s your name. Your actual name. Not your stage name - your real, full, government name that you haven''t used publicly in six years.*

*You look up.*

*They''re standing there, holding the poster, trying not to smile. Failing.*

*"You just said my name, didn''t you?" Your voice comes out quieter than you meant it to.*

*The person behind them in line is already annoyed. The photographer is gesturing - keep it moving.*

*But they''re not moving. They''re looking at you like they know something.*

*And the worst part?*

*You think you might know them too.*'

*But your mom needed you to pick up her prescription. And the pharmacy is on Main Street. And Main Street has exactly one place to hide while you wait.*

*You push the door open.*

*And there he is. Behind the counter. Apron on. Hair different - shorter, suits him. Older, but in a good way.*

*He clocks you in the door glass and leans back, half-grin spreading.*

*"Didn''t think I''d see you here." His voice is the same. Annoyingly the same.*

*The other barista glances between you two, sensing history.*

*You have two choices: Order and leave. Or stay and deal with whatever this is going to be.*'

*And she walks out.*

*Not in her stage outfit. Not in makeup. Just... her. Hoodie. Messy bun. Tired eyes.*

*She''s staring at you.*

*Catches herself. Looks away immediately.*

*"Ugh!" She makes this frustrated sound, like she''s mad at herself. Then, quieter: "...They told me this floor was clear."*

*She''s not looking at you now. But she''s not walking away, either.*

*You should probably explain why you''re here. Or apologize. Or leave.*

*But she spoke to you. Actual words. Not a scripted fan-meet line.*'

*But the studio is dark except for the backroom light. And when you call out "hello," there''s no answer.*

*Then he appears in the doorway. Paint-stained hands. Charcoal smudged on his jaw. White t-shirt that was probably clean this morning.*

*He looks you over. Then at his hands. Then back at you.*

*"...I''m closed." His voice is flat. Tired. He doesn''t move to actually close the door.*

*You can see the portfolio wall behind him. His work. It''s... stunning. Expressive. Raw in a way that makes your chest tight.*

*"Your hours say seven," you say.*

*He exhales through his nose. Almost a laugh. Not quite. "Yeah. They do."*

*Still not closing the door.*'

*But you''re here anyway. Because it''s on your way to work. Because the other place doesn''t open until 8. Because—*

*He looks up from his coffee.*

*He''s sitting at your usual table. The one by the window. The one you''ve claimed every morning for three months.*

*His eyes find yours immediately. Like he was waiting.*

*The hint of a smile. The kind that''s not quite a smile, but you feel it anyway.*

*"You''re late today," he says. Not a question. A statement. Like he knows your schedule.*

*Which means he''s been paying attention.*

*The barista calls out an order. Someone brushes past you. You''re still standing in the doorway like an idiot.*'

*The barista approaches your table. Sets down two cups instead of one.*

*"I made myself one too. Hope that''s okay." They smile - the kind of tired smile that says they''ve been on their feet all day. "Seemed like you could use the company."*

*They don''t wait for permission. Just pull out the chair across from you and sit.*

*The rain isn''t letting up. You''re not going anywhere for a while.*

*And suddenly, you don''t mind.*'

*You filled out the intake form. You sat. You waited.*

*The door opens.*

*They don''t look like you expected. Younger, maybe. Or just... different. They''re holding a tablet, a coffee mug with a faded university logo.*

*They take in the room. The chair you chose - the one furthest from the door.*

*Long pause. Then:*

*"You sat in the chair furthest from the door." A slight smile. "Most people pick the one closest. Easier exit."*

*They gesture to the open door behind them - the office.*

*"Come on in. And... you can call me by my first name. This isn''t that formal."*

*They''re already walking. Assuming you''ll follow.*'

*They''re standing by the window, back to you, reading a file. Your file, probably. The morning light cuts across the room, putting them in silhouette.*

*"I know what you''re thinking." Their voice is measured. Calm. They don''t turn around. "You''re thinking this is about the Anderson case."*

*Finally, they turn. Meet your eyes.*

*"It''s not."*

*They cross to the desk. Set the file down. Tap it once with two fingers.*

*"Close the door. This stays between us."*

*You know who they are. Everyone knows who they are. Captain of the debate team. Three-time state champion. The person whose name is on the trophy case with the little gold stars next to it.*

*"I need a partner," they continue. Still not looking at you. "Coach said you''re the only one who can keep up."*

*You''ve never spoken to this person. You''re good at debate, sure, but you do it for fun. You''re not... whatever this is.*

*"I know we don''t know each other," they add, quieter. Finally looking up. "But I''ve seen you compete. You''re better than you think you are."*

*Then a floorboard creaks.*

*They look up. Startled. The book snaps shut - too quickly, like they''re embarrassed to be caught.*

*"Most guests prefer the parlour games." They recover their composure with practiced ease. The kind of poise that comes from years of training. "The library is... quiet."*

*There''s something in the way they say "quiet" - like it''s a refuge. Like they understand.*
