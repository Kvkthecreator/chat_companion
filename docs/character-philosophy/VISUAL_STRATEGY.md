# Visual Strategy - Product Vision

> How images create emotional value and retention in Fantazy.

**Related:** [IMAGE_STRATEGY.md](../IMAGE_STRATEGY.md) for technical implementation details

## Image Philosophy

Images serve three distinct purposes in Fantazy:

| Role | Purpose | Emotional Value |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Avatar** | Identity anchor—who you're with | Recognition, familiarity |
| **Scene Card** | Story moment—what happened | Memory, investment |
| **Gallery** | Collection of moments | "We have history" feeling |

**Design principle:** Images are anchors to narrative and memory, not decoration.

## Scene Cards as Memory Artifacts

Scene cards are **story postcards**—visual souvenirs from conversations that matter.

### What They Capture
- A specific moment from conversation context
- The physical setting of the episode
- The character's expression/action in that moment

### Where They Live
- Inline in chat (as they're generated)
- Gallery page (all scenes from all conversations)
- "Saved" star indicates user-marked memories

### Value to Users
- **Investment**: "We've been through things together"
- **Shareability**: Visual moments users screenshot and share
- **Return reason**: "I want to see what images I can create"

## Stickiness Through Visuals

### The Four Pillars Applied to Images

| Pillar | How Images Help |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Emotional Bond** | Scene cards capture shared moments |
| **Progress/Investment** | Gallery shows "our history together" |
| **Variable Rewards** | Special scenes at milestones feel earned |
| **Habit Loop** | "What moment will I capture today?" |

### Gallery as Progress Indicator

The Gallery page serves as a visual timeline of the relationship:
- Shows ALL generated scenes (not just "saved" ones)
- Organized by series/episode context
- Demonstrates the depth of user investment

### Key Insight

Users don't need to "opt-in" to save images. Simply generating them creates value:
- The generation act is the engagement
- Gallery shows everything they've created
- Star/save is for marking special favorites

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measures |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Scenes per user | 3+ | Engagement with visual feature |
| Gallery visits | 1+ per week | Investment visibility working |
| Scene generation rate | 1 per 3 conversations | Feature discovery |
