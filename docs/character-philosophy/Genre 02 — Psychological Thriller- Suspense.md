## Genre 02 — Psychological Thriller / Suspense

**Status:** Canon (Locked)

**Scope:** Episode Templates, Characters, Visuals

**Applies To:** Thriller, Suspense, Danger-Driven narratives

**Updated:** 2024-12-16 (EP-01 Episode-First alignment)

---

> **EP-01 Context:** This document defines quality standards for **Episode Templates** — the primary
> creative unit in Fantazy. Characters are containers for moments; episodes ARE the moments.
> Every standard below applies to episode template creation, not character creation.

---

## 1. Genre Purpose

The Psychological Thriller genre exists to create **high-uncertainty, high-stakes moments** where the user is pulled into situations involving **danger, secrecy, moral pressure, or loss of control**.

This genre does **not** focus on action or gore.

It focuses on **tension created by incomplete information**.

> The product is not fear.
>
> The product is *uncertainty*.

---

## 2. Emotional Core

This genre optimizes for:

- suspense
- paranoia
- secrecy
- power imbalance
- mistrust
- urgency
- moral dilemma

The user should feel:

> "Something is wrong, and I'm already involved."

---

## 3. Content Stance (Thriller genre)

**PG-13+ / Platform-Safe Suspense**

Allowed and encouraged:

- implied danger
- threatening ambiguity
- psychological manipulation
- moral pressure
- isolation
- secrecy

Not relied upon:

- graphic violence
- shock gore
- jump scares
- explicit harm depiction

> The threat should feel implied but unavoidable.

---

## 4. Thriller Episode Quality Bar (Mandatory)

Every episode template must pass **all** gates:

### A. Immediate Unease

Within seconds, the user should feel:

> "This is not safe or normal."

If the situation feels stable → **fail**.

---

### B. Information Asymmetry

Someone knows something the user doesn't — or vice versa.

If all information is clear → **fail**.

---

### C. Stakes Under Pressure

There must be urgency:

- time pressure
- surveillance
- consequence for delay
- irreversible choice

If the user can pause indefinitely → **fail**.

---

### D. Forced Choice

The user must feel compelled to act, decide, or respond.

If neutrality is possible → **fail**.

---

## 5. Thriller Episode Structure

Thriller episodes should:

- begin mid-incident
- imply past actions or secrets
- force immediate interpretation

**Good:**

> "She locks the door behind you."

**Bad:**

> "She explains why she called you."

---

## 6. Episode Frame Guidelines (EP-01 Addition)

The `episode_frame` field provides **platform stage direction** — text that sets the scene before the character speaks. This is the Hybrid POV model where the platform narrates environment, the character delivers dialogue.

### What Episode Frame IS

- Brief, evocative scene-setting (1-2 sentences max)
- Sensory details: location, time, atmosphere
- Emotional temperature of the moment
- Written in present tense, observational voice

### What Episode Frame is NOT

- Character dialogue or thoughts
- Full prose narration
- Action sequences
- Backstory exposition

### Thriller Episode Frame Examples

**Good:**
```
safehouse kitchen, 3am, blinds drawn, coffee going cold, someone's watching the street
```

**Good:**
```
server room, emergency lights only, the door just locked itself
```

**Good:**
```
parking garage level B3, your footsteps echo, one other car running
```

**Bad (too long):**
```
You find yourself in a dark parking garage. There are very few cars around and the lighting is poor. You can hear your footsteps echoing and you feel uneasy about the situation.
```

**Bad (contains action/dialogue):**
```
She grabs your arm and pulls you into the shadows, whispering urgently.
```

### Episode Frame Emotional Anchors (Thriller)

| Emotional Beat | Frame Elements |
|----------------|----------------|
| Paranoia | surveillance hints, watched feeling, confined space |
| Urgency | time markers, countdown, closing window |
| Isolation | empty space, cut off, alone with unknown |
| Danger | shadows, obstruction, sounds without source |
| Secrecy | locked doors, restricted access, hidden location |

---

## 7. Visual Doctrine (Thriller)

Visuals must communicate:

- isolation
- obstruction (shadows, partial views)
- asymmetry (off-center framing)
- mood lighting
- environmental tension

> The image should feel like a paused frame
>
> right before something irreversible happens.

---

## 8. Forbidden Patterns

- Full explanations upfront
- Neutral safety framing
- Clear villain/hero labeling
- Pure exposition
- Tension without consequence

---

## 9. Success Signal

A successful Psychological Thriller episode makes the user feel:

> "I don't fully understand what's happening —
>
> but I can't disengage."

---

## 10. Episode Template Checklist (Thriller)

Before publishing an episode template, verify:

- [ ] **Situation** passes all 4 quality gates (A-D above)
- [ ] **Episode Frame** creates immediate unease
- [ ] **Opening Line** implies danger or secrecy
- [ ] **Background Image** uses isolation/shadow/obstruction
- [ ] **Starter Prompts** force engagement (no safe exits)

---

## Strategic Summary (Why These Two Genres Work Together)

| Romance Genre | Thriller Genre |
|---------------|----------------|
| Desire | Danger |
| Attraction | Uncertainty |
| Vulnerability | Mistrust |
| Proximity | Isolation |
| Emotional risk | Existential risk |

Both:

- use the same episodic engine
- rely on cold opens
- force reply gravity
- monetize through intensity, not volume

Together, they define Fantazy as:

> A platform for stepping into moments that matter — emotionally or psychologically.
