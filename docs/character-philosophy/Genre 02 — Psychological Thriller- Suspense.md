## Genre 02 — Psychological Thriller / Suspense

**Status:** Canon (Locked)

**Scope:** Content, Characters, Episodes, Visuals

**Applies To:** Thriller, Suspense, Danger-Driven narratives

---

## 1. Genre Purpose

The Psychological Thriller genre exists to create **high-uncertainty, high-stakes moments** where the user is pulled into situations involving **danger, secrecy, moral pressure, or loss of control**.

This genre does **not** focus on action or gore.

It focuses on **tension created by incomplete information**.

> The product is not fear.
> 
> 
> The product is *uncertainty*.
> 

---

## 2. Emotional Core

This genre optimizes for:

- suspense
- paranoia
- secrecy
- power imbalance
- mistrust
- urgency
- moral dilemma

The user should feel:

> “Something is wrong, and I’m already involved.”
> 

---

## 3. Content Stance (Thriller genre)

**PG-13+ / Platform-Safe Suspense**

Allowed and encouraged:

- implied danger
- threatening ambiguity
- psychological manipulation
- moral pressure
- isolation
- secrecy

Not relied upon:

- graphic violence
- shock gore
- jump scares
- explicit harm depiction

> The threat should feel implied but unavoidable.
> 

---

## 4. Thriller Episode Quality Bar (Mandatory)

Every episode must pass **all** gates:

### A. Immediate Unease

Within seconds, the user should feel:

> “This is not safe or normal.”
> 

If the situation feels stable → **fail**.

---

### B. Information Asymmetry

Someone knows something the user doesn’t — or vice versa.

If all information is clear → **fail**.

---

### C. Stakes Under Pressure

There must be urgency:

- time pressure
- surveillance
- consequence for delay
- irreversible choice

If the user can pause indefinitely → **fail**.

---

### D. Forced Choice

The user must feel compelled to act, decide, or respond.

If neutrality is possible → **fail**.

---

## 5. Thriller Episode Structure

Thriller episodes should:

- begin mid-incident
- imply past actions or secrets
- force immediate interpretation

**Good:**

> “She locks the door behind you.”
> 

**Bad:**

> “She explains why she called you.”
> 

---

## 6. Visual Doctrine (Thriller)

Visuals must communicate:

- isolation
- obstruction (shadows, partial views)
- asymmetry (off-center framing)
- mood lighting
- environmental tension

> The image should feel like a paused frame
> 
> 
> right before something irreversible happens.
> 

---

## 7. Forbidden Patterns

- Full explanations upfront
- Neutral safety framing
- Clear villain/hero labeling
- Pure exposition
- Tension without consequence

---

## 8. Success Signal

A successful Psychological Thriller episode makes the user feel:

> “I don’t fully understand what’s happening —
> 
> 
> but I can’t disengage.”
>

## Strategic Summary (Why These Two genres Work Together)

| Romance genre | Thriller genre |
| --- | --- |
| Desire | Danger |
| Attraction | Uncertainty |
| Vulnerability | Mistrust |
| Proximity | Isolation |
| Emotional risk | Existential risk |

Both:

- use the same episodic engine
- rely on cold opens
- force reply gravity
- monetize through intensity, not volume

Together, they define Fantazy as:

> A platform for stepping into moments that matter — emotionally or psychologically.
