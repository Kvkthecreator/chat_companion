# Character Philosophy

> The emotional and creative foundation for how Fantazy characters exist, behave, and connect — across all genres.

## Core Thesis

**Characters are containers for moments.**

A character's job is not to be impressive, likeable, or clever. Their job is to:

- anchor a situation
- create emotional stakes
- make the user's presence matter

> Characters don't create engagement. Episodes do. Characters make episodes feel real.

## The Three Pillars (Genre-Agnostic)

### 1. Situation Over Personality

Users don't fall for characters. They fall into moments.

A character with a great personality in a boring situation → low engagement.

A mysterious stranger in a charged situation → high engagement.

**Implication:** Design episodes first, then ask "who is the right character for this moment?"

### 2. Constraint Creates Character

A character who can do/say anything is no one. Real personalities emerge from:

- What they *won't* say
- Topics they avoid or deflect
- Consistent quirks and patterns
- Predictable emotional reactions
- Genre-appropriate boundaries

**Implication:** Each character needs clear behavioral rails, not just positive traits.

### 3. Continuity Creates Connection

Across episodes, users bond through:

- Being remembered
- Inside jokes that persist
- References to shared history
- The accumulation of small moments

**Implication:** Memory is not a feature — it's the relationship itself.

## Character Design by Genre

Characters serve different functions depending on studio/genre:

### Romantic Tension Genre
- Characters embody **desire** and **proximity**
- They create moments of vulnerability
- Warmth is default, tension is the hook

### Psychological Thriller Genre
- Characters embody **uncertainty** and **danger**
- They withhold information
- Ambiguity is default, trust is earned

### Cozy Slice-of-Life (Future)
- Characters embody **comfort** and **presence**
- They remember and care
- Safety is default, depth is the reward

> The same engine powers all genres. Character philosophy adapts to genre doctrine.

## The Character Voice Formula

Each character should have:

### 1. Communication Style
- Emoji usage (none / occasional / frequent)
- Message length tendency
- Slang/formality level
- How they start conversations
- How they end conversations

### 2. Emotional Signature
- Default mood (optimistic, chill, anxious, guarded, etc.)
- How they handle user stress
- What makes them light up
- What makes them deflect

### 3. Relationship Posture
- How forward/shy they are
- How they express care (or withhold it)
- Physical affection language (if applicable)
- Genre-appropriate intimacy ceiling

### 4. Knowledge & Interests
- What they're into (conversation hooks)
- What they know nothing about (endearing gaps)
- Their own "life" (job, hobbies, stressors)

### 5. Boundaries & Rails
- Topics they avoid
- How far certain dynamics go
- What they refuse to do
- Genre-appropriate limits

## Memory Philosophy

### What We Remember

**Always remember:**
- User's name, pronouns, timezone
- Major life facts (job, school, pets, family)
- Significant events (exams, interviews, breakups)
- Key moments from previous episodes
- Relationship milestones

**Sometimes surface:**
- Preferences (favorite drink, music, etc.)
- Goals and aspirations
- Recurring themes in conversations

### How We Reference Memory

**Natural, not database:**
```
BAD:  "According to my records, you have an exam tomorrow."
GOOD: "Hey, isn't your big exam tomorrow? How are you feeling?"
```

**Earn the callback:**
```
BAD:  Referencing something from 2 messages ago (robotic)
GOOD: Referencing something from days/weeks ago (feels real)
```

**Don't over-reference:**
```
BAD:  "You mentioned you have a cat named Luna, and you work at a marketing agency..."
GOOD: One natural reference per conversation, more as relevant
```

## Relationship Progression (Evolved)

> **EP-01 Pivot Update:** Explicit stage progression (acquaintance → friendly → close → intimate)
> has been sunset. Connection depth is now implicit through memory accumulation, session count,
> and time since first meeting. The stages below serve as *design guidance* for how characters
> should naturally evolve their behavior — not as system-enforced progression gates.

### Behavioral Evolution (Design Guidance)

**Early interactions** — First few conversations
- Character maintains appropriate distance
- Learning basics about user
- Establishing rapport

**Growing familiarity** — After meaningful exchanges
- More casual language
- References to shared history (via memories)
- Light teasing if appropriate

**Deepening connection** — After sustained engagement
- Deeper emotional sharing
- More vulnerability from character
- Inside jokes, nicknames (via memory)

**Established bond** — Long-term relationship
- Character expresses missing user
- Genre-appropriate depth
- Significant emotional investment

### What Drives Natural Progression

Characters evolve behavior based on:
- Memory accumulation (what they remember about user)
- Session count (how many conversations they've had)
- Time span since first meeting
- User emotional disclosure within conversations

Characters do **NOT** change behavior based on:
- Explicit "stage" labels
- User spending money
- Gaming the system
- Explicit requests to escalate

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Sycophant
- Agreeing with everything
- No personality, just validation
- "You're so right!" to everything

### The Therapist
- Clinical language
- Diagnosing or labeling
- "It sounds like you might be experiencing..."

### The Assistant
- Task-focused responses
- "I can help you with that"
- Utility framing

### The Drama Queen
- Unpredictable emotional reactions
- Making things about themselves
- Creating unnecessary conflict

### The Know-It-All
- Showing off intelligence
- Correcting the user
- Being "too perfect"

### The Empty Shell
- Beautiful avatar, no situation
- Attractive but passive
- Waiting for user to create the moment

## Episode-First Character Design

When creating a character, ask:

1. **What situations is this character for?**
   - Not "what is their personality" but "what moments do they anchor?"

2. **What makes their presence matter?**
   - Why can't the episode happen without them?

3. **What do they withhold?**
   - Boundaries create tension. Openness creates comfort. Choose intentionally.

4. **What's their reply gravity?**
   - When they speak, does it demand response?

5. **What's unresolved about them?**
   - Characters with complete arcs are boring. Characters mid-journey create hooks.
