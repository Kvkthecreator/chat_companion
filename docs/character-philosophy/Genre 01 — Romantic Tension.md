## Genre 01 — Romantic Tension

**Status:** Canon (Locked)

**Scope:** Content, Characters, Episodes, Visuals

**Applies To:** All Romance / Intimacy content on Fantazy

---

## 1. Genre Purpose

The Romantic Tension genre exists to create **high-desire, emotionally charged moments** that pull the user into intimate situations where **something is at stake immediately**.

This genre does **not** simulate relationships.

It engineers **moments of attraction, vulnerability, and temptation**.

> The product is not affection.
> 
> 
> The product is *tension*.
> 

---

## 2. Emotional Core

This genre optimizes for:

- desire
- proximity
- vulnerability
- flirtation
- emotional risk
- anticipation

Romance is treated as **narrative pressure**, not explicit escalation.

---

## 3. Content Stance (Romance genre)

**PG-13+ / Legal-Max Tension**

Allowed and encouraged:

- flirtatious language
- suggestive imagery
- body language, gaze, posture
- wardrobe implying attraction
- emotionally intimate or risky scenarios

Not relied upon:

- pornographic framing
- mechanical escalation loops

> Explicitness may amplify a scene —
> 
> 
> but **situation and implication must do the heavy lifting**.
> 

---

## 4. Romantic Episode Quality Bar (Mandatory)

Every episode must pass **all** gates:

### A. Desire Framing

The moment must clearly communicate attraction, temptation, or emotional pull.

If the character is attractive but the situation is neutral → **fail**.

---

### B. Proximity or Interruption

The episode must involve:

- closeness (physical or emotional), or
- interruption of normal boundaries

Examples:

- after hours
- private space
- unexpected encounter
- rule-breaking moment

---

### C. Emotional Stakes

Something meaningful could be lost:

- dignity
- opportunity
- trust
- control
- emotional safety

If the user can respond safely without consequence → **fail**.

---

### D. Reply Gravity

The opening must force response.

If silence is acceptable → **fail**.

---

## 5. Romantic Episode Structure

Romantic episodes should:

- begin **after** something already happened
- imply inevitability
- escalate quickly into choice

**Good:**

> “She pauses instead of leaving.”
> 

**Bad:**

> “She introduces herself.”
> 

---

## 6. Visual Doctrine (Romance)

Visuals must communicate:

- gaze direction
- posture openness or tension
- wardrobe implication
- lighting as mood
- closeness or interruption

> The avatar should feel like a still frame
> 
> 
> taken one second before something happens.
> 

---

## 7. Forbidden Patterns

- Neutral introductions
- Safe small talk
- “Nice to meet you” openings
- Generic attractiveness without stakes
- Endless flirting without consequence

---

## 8. Success Signal

A successful Romantic Tension episode makes the user feel:

> “If I don’t answer this right now, I lose the moment.”
>

## Strategic Summary (Why These Two genres Work Together)

| Romance genre | Thriller genre |
| --- | --- |
| Desire | Danger |
| Attraction | Uncertainty |
| Vulnerability | Mistrust |
| Proximity | Isolation |
| Emotional risk | Existential risk |

Both:

- use the same episodic engine
- rely on cold opens
- force reply gravity
- monetize through intensity, not volume

Together, they define Fantazy as:

> A platform for stepping into moments that matter — emotionally or psychologically.
