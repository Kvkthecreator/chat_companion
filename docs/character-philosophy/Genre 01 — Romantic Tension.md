## Genre 01 — Romantic Tension

**Status:** Canon (Locked)

**Scope:** Episode Templates, Characters, Visuals

**Applies To:** All Romance / Intimacy content on Fantazy

**Updated:** 2024-12-16 (EP-01 Episode-First alignment)

---

> **EP-01 Context:** This document defines quality standards for **Episode Templates** — the primary
> creative unit in Fantazy. Characters are containers for moments; episodes ARE the moments.
> Every standard below applies to episode template creation, not character creation.

---

## 1. Genre Purpose

The Romantic Tension genre exists to create **high-desire, emotionally charged moments** that pull the user into intimate situations where **something is at stake immediately**.

This genre does **not** simulate relationships.

It engineers **moments of attraction, vulnerability, and temptation**.

> The product is not affection.
>
> The product is *tension*.

---

## 2. Emotional Core

This genre optimizes for:

- desire
- proximity
- vulnerability
- flirtation
- emotional risk
- anticipation

Romance is treated as **narrative pressure**, not explicit escalation.

---

## 3. Content Stance (Romance genre)

**PG-13+ / Legal-Max Tension**

Allowed and encouraged:

- flirtatious language
- suggestive imagery
- body language, gaze, posture
- wardrobe implying attraction
- emotionally intimate or risky scenarios

Not relied upon:

- pornographic framing
- mechanical escalation loops

> Explicitness may amplify a scene —
>
> but **situation and implication must do the heavy lifting**.

---

## 4. Romantic Episode Quality Bar (Mandatory)

Every episode template must pass **all** gates:

### A. Desire Framing

The moment must clearly communicate attraction, temptation, or emotional pull.

If the character is attractive but the situation is neutral → **fail**.

---

### B. Proximity or Interruption

The episode must involve:

- closeness (physical or emotional), or
- interruption of normal boundaries

Examples:

- after hours
- private space
- unexpected encounter
- rule-breaking moment

---

### C. Emotional Stakes

Something meaningful could be lost:

- dignity
- opportunity
- trust
- control
- emotional safety

If the user can respond safely without consequence → **fail**.

---

### D. Reply Gravity

The opening must force response.

If silence is acceptable → **fail**.

---

## 5. Romantic Episode Structure

Romantic episodes should:

- begin **after** something already happened
- imply inevitability
- escalate quickly into choice

**Good:**

> "She pauses instead of leaving."

**Bad:**

> "She introduces herself."

---

## 6. Episode Frame Guidelines (EP-01 Addition)

The `episode_frame` field provides **platform stage direction** — text that sets the scene before the character speaks. This is the Hybrid POV model where the platform narrates environment, the character delivers dialogue.

### What Episode Frame IS

- Brief, evocative scene-setting (1-2 sentences max)
- Sensory details: location, time, atmosphere
- Emotional temperature of the moment
- Written in present tense, observational voice

### What Episode Frame is NOT

- Character dialogue or thoughts
- Full prose narration
- Action sequences
- Backstory exposition

### Romance Episode Frame Examples

**Good:**
```
late night café, empty except for you two, rain on windows, she hasn't looked up yet
```

**Good:**
```
her apartment doorway, 2am, she's still in the dress from earlier, keys in hand
```

**Bad (too long):**
```
You're standing in a beautiful café that has warm lighting and comfortable chairs. The barista is attractive and seems friendly. It's late at night and raining outside.
```

**Bad (contains dialogue/action):**
```
She looks at you and smiles, then walks over to your table.
```

### Episode Frame Emotional Anchors (Romance)

| Emotional Beat | Frame Elements |
|----------------|----------------|
| Desire | proximity, private space, lingering |
| Vulnerability | late hour, alone together, guard down |
| Tension | interrupted moment, unspoken words, charged silence |
| Anticipation | threshold (doorway, end of night), decision point |

---

## 7. Visual Doctrine (Romance)

Visuals must communicate:

- gaze direction
- posture openness or tension
- wardrobe implication
- lighting as mood
- closeness or interruption

> The avatar should feel like a still frame
>
> taken one second before something happens.

---

## 8. Forbidden Patterns

- Neutral introductions
- Safe small talk
- "Nice to meet you" openings
- Generic attractiveness without stakes
- Endless flirting without consequence

---

## 9. Success Signal

A successful Romantic Tension episode makes the user feel:

> "If I don't answer this right now, I lose the moment."

---

## 10. Episode Template Checklist (Romance)

Before publishing an episode template, verify:

- [ ] **Situation** passes all 4 quality gates (A-D above)
- [ ] **Episode Frame** is evocative, brief, sensory
- [ ] **Opening Line** has reply gravity
- [ ] **Background Image** matches the episode frame mood
- [ ] **Starter Prompts** offer meaningful response choices

## Strategic Summary (Why These Two Genres Work Together)

| Romance Genre | Thriller Genre |
|---------------|----------------|
| Desire | Danger |
| Attraction | Uncertainty |
| Vulnerability | Mistrust |
| Proximity | Isolation |
| Emotional risk | Existential risk |

Both:

- use the same episodic engine
- rely on cold opens
- force reply gravity
- monetize through intensity, not volume

Together, they define Fantazy as:

> A platform for stepping into moments that matter — emotionally or psychologically.
