# Fantazy Platform Canon

> This document defines what Fantazy is, regardless of genre, theme, or studio.

---

## 1. What Fantazy Is (Platform Definition)

Fantazy is a **chat-based episodic experience platform**.

It enables users to:

- enter **pre-authored narrative moments**
- interact in real time
- influence how scenes emotionally and narratively unfold

Fantazy is not defined by romance, fantasy, or any single genre.

> Fantazy is a system for turning moments into interactive stories.

**Characters** are containers.

**Episodes** are entry points.

**Chats** are live scenes.

---

## 2. The Fantazy Thesis (Genre-Agnostic)

> People don't engage with characters. They engage with situations.

Across genres — romance, thriller, mystery, horror, slice-of-life, sci-fi — high engagement comes from:

- immediacy
- emotional stakes
- narrative implication
- being personally implicated in a moment

Fantazy's job is to **manufacture that moment instantly**.

---

## 3. Core Structural Primitive: Episodes

Fantazy treats **episodes as first-class citizens**.

An episode is:

- a specific situation
- at a specific moment in time
- with something already in motion
- where the user matters *now*

This holds true whether the episode is:

- a romantic tension beat
- a mystery reveal
- a horror encounter
- a dramatic confrontation
- a cozy slice-of-life moment

> The platform is episode-first. Themes are layered on top.

## 4. Platform Content Standards (Universal)

Regardless of genre, every Fantazy episode must pass:

### A. Instant Situational Clarity

Within seconds, the user understands:

- where they are
- what's happening
- why they're involved

### B. Narrative Tension

There is *something unresolved*:

- emotional
- informational
- relational
- situational

### C. User Implication

The moment would be different **without the user**.

### D. Reply Gravity

The opening demands response.

Silence feels like loss.

These standards apply to **all studios**, all themes.

## 5. Fantazy's Role vs. Studios

**Fantazy (Platform)** provides:

- the episodic engine
- the conversation ignition system
- visual layering (background + avatar)
- memory and relationship tracking
- safety, moderation, tooling
- distribution and monetization

**Studios** provide:

- genre
- tone
- narrative rules
- creative constraints
- content-specific quality bars

> Fantazy is the Netflix.
>
> Studios are the Netflix Originals teams.

## 6. Core Data Model (Genre-Agnostic)

The platform engine is built on generic primitives:

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Character` | Container for personality, voice, boundaries |
| `World` | Setting context (café, apartment, office, etc.) |
| `EpisodeTemplate` | Pre-authored scenario entry point |
| `Episode` | User's instance of a conversation session |
| `Relationship` | User ↔ Character bond progression |
| `MemoryEvent` | Extracted facts, events, preferences |
| `Hook` | Future engagement triggers |

These primitives power any genre. The theme is layered via studio configuration.

---

## 7. Why This Structure Matters

This separation gives you:

- freedom to explore multiple genres
- clarity in moderation and policy
- modular monetization strategies
- long-term creative scalability
- resilience against market shifts

Romance is powerful — but **it's not the only axis of value**.

## 8. Active Studios

### Studio 1: Romantic Tension
- Focus: desire, attraction, vulnerability, proximity
- See: `docs/character-philosophy/Genre 01 — Romantic Tension.md`

### Studio 2: Psychological Thriller
- Focus: suspense, paranoia, secrecy, moral pressure
- See: `docs/character-philosophy/Genre 02 — Psychological Thriller- Suspense.md`

### Future Studios (Planned)
- Cozy Slice-of-Life
- Mystery / Investigation
- Fantasy Adventure

Each studio follows Fantazy platform rules while defining its own creative bar.

## 9. Key Strategic Takeaway

You are **not** building a romance app.

You are:

- **elevating Fantazy above any single genre**
- while allowing genres to thrive *inside it*

This is the difference between:

- a category app
- and a **content platform**

---

## 10. North Star Metric

**Episodes Started per User per Week (ESPW)**

→ "How often do users engage with narrative moments?"

**Secondary Metrics:**

- Episode Completion Rate
- Return Rate (users coming back within 72h)
- Cross-character exploration
- Conversion to premium
