## Overview

This document defines the content structure and copy for the 5 romantic tropes used in Play Mode. The content is designed for **maximum shareability** with "group chat energy" - the kind of observations that make people screenshot and send to friends.

**Design Principle**: Spicy but affectionate. Brutal honesty wrapped in love. Make them feel seen and slightly attacked (in a good way).

## The 5 Romantic Tropes

### 1. The Slow Burn

**Title**: The Slow Burn
**Tagline**: "You'll die on this hill and you know it"

**The Read**:
> You've planned a whole relationship in your head before they even know your last name. You call it 'taking it slow' but really you're just terrified to ruin the fantasy by asking if they're single.

**Coaching**:
- DO: Shoot your shot before they get engaged to someone else
- DO: Accept that 'we have a vibe' isn't a relationship
- DO: Remember that rejection is better than 8 months of wondering
- DON'T: Write another unsent letter
- DON'T: Start your 47th draft of that 'casual' text
- DON'T: Stalk their Spotify activity instead of texting them

**Cultural Roast**:
> Elizabeth Bennet walked so you could run... slowly. Very slowly. Dangerously slowly.

**Cultural References**:
- Pride & Prejudice (Darcy & Elizabeth)
- The Office (Jim & Pam)
- Normal People (Connell & Marianne)
- When Harry Met Sally (Harry & Sally)

### 2. The Second Chance

**Title**: The Second Chance
**Tagline**: "The ex files"

**The Read**:
> You've texted 'hey' at 1am to someone you swore you were over. Your Notes app has a draft apology from 2022 you never sent. You're not hung up, you're 'hopeful.'

**Coaching**:
- DO: Ask yourself if they've actually changed (or if you just miss the idea of them)
- DO: Accept that some chapters end for a reason
- DO: Delete the ex's number (for real this time)
- DON'T: Mistake nostalgia for love
- DON'T: Check their Instagram at 2am 'just to see'
- DON'T: Convince yourself Mercury retrograde is a valid reason to reconnect

**Cultural Roast**:
> You have their Spotify wrapped screenshot from 2 years ago saved. Don't lie.

**Cultural References**:
- La La Land (Mia & Sebastian)
- The Notebook (Noah & Allie)
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Joel & Clementine)
- Before Sunset (Jesse & Celine)

---

### 3. The All In

**Title**: The All In
**Tagline**: "No thoughts, just vibes and commitment"

**The Read**:
> You've said 'I love you' first in every relationship. Sometimes on the second date. You call it knowing what you want. Therapists call it something else.

**Coaching**:
- DO: Let them finish their sentence before planning the wedding
- DO: Verify they're single before falling in love
- DO: Give them space to miss you occasionally
- DON'T: Name the kids on date three
- DON'T: U-Haul it (unless they're also an All In, then godspeed)
- DON'T: Mistake intensity for compatibility

**Cultural Roast**:
> Your friends are tired of hearing 'I just know' about someone you met Tuesday.

**Cultural References**:
- Crazy Rich Asians (Rachel & Nick)
- The Proposal (Margaret & Andrew)
- To All the Boys I've Loved Before (Lara Jean & Peter)
- Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Jake & Amy)

### 4. The Push & Pull

**Title**: The Push & Pull
**Tagline**: "Emotionally unavailable? It's called mystery"

**The Read**:
> You left someone on read for 6 hours to seem busy then checked if they were typing. You're not playing games, you're just 'protecting your energy.'

**Coaching**:
- DO: Reply within a reasonable time like a normal person
- DO: Say you like them instead of being 'playfully mean'
- DO: Recognize that confusion isn't the same as chemistry
- DON'T: Ghost and come back with 'sorry I was in a tunnel'
- DON'T: Create chaos because you're bored
- DON'T: Mistake anxiety for butterflies

**Cultural Roast**:
> You've definitely confused someone who was genuinely interested. Multiple times.

**Cultural References**:
- 10 Things I Hate About You (Kat & Patrick)
- New Girl (Jess & Nick)
- Gilmore Girls (Lorelai & Luke)
- How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (Andie & Ben)

### 5. The Slow Reveal

**Title**: The Slow Reveal
**Tagline**: "Trauma? I call it depth"

**The Read**:
> People think you're mysterious but really you just dissociate mid-conversation. You've been 'almost ready to open up' for 3 years. Your walls have walls.

**Coaching**:
- DO: Share ONE (1) personal thing this month
- DO: Let someone see you cry (revolutionary, I know)
- DO: Accept that vulnerability is not the same as weakness
- DON'T: Deflect with humor when they ask how you're really doing
- DON'T: Mistake emotional unavailability for being 'low maintenance'
- DON'T: Disappear when things get real

**Cultural Roast**:
> You've said 'I'm fine' so convincingly that even you believed it.

**Cultural References**:
- Jane Eyre (Jane & Rochester)
- Fleabag (Fleabag & The Priest)
- Twilight (Bella & Edward)
- Mr. & Mrs. Smith (John & Jane)

## LLM-Generated Content

The following are generated per-user by the evaluation LLM:

### Your Receipts (Evidence)
3 specific observations based on their actual conversation:
- Should be spicy but affectionate
- Reference specific things they said/did
- Make them think "WHY IS THIS SO TRUE"

**Prompt guidance**: "Lovingly roast them. Think 'group chat energy.'"

**Example outputs**:
- "You deflected with humor twice when things got real - classic defense mechanism, bestie"
- "You said 'I should probably go' but stayed another hour. We noticed."
- "The way you circled back to that one topic three times? Not subtle."

### The Moment We Knew (Callback Quote)
Their most revealing/unhinged moment from the conversation:
- Quote them directly (or paraphrase if too long)
- Add framing that's slightly roast-y
- Should feel embarrassingly accurate

**Format**: `When you said "[quote]" — [framing]`

**Examples**:
- `When you said "I should probably go" — but you stayed. Very slow burn of you.`
- `When you asked what they've been up to "lately" — you meant since 2019.`
