# Product Wedge Exploration

> Working log of positioning exploration. No conclusions reached.

## What This Document Is

This is an **exploration log**, not a strategy document. It records:
- Wedge options considered
- ICP hypotheses drafted
- Questions asked
- Paths explored and abandoned

**None of this is validated.** The product hasn't been tested with real users.

## The Starting Problem

**Current positioning (too generic):**
> "AI companion that remembers you and reaches out first"

**Why this fails:**
- ChatGPT has memory now
- Replika reaches out first
- "Companion" is overused
- Nothing makes someone stop scrolling

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | Memory | Proactive | Thread Tracking | Memory Transparency |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Replika | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pi | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Woebot/Wysa | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Chat Companion** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Potential differentiators:**
1. Thread tracking (ongoing life situations with follow-up dates)
2. Memory transparency (user sees/controls what's remembered)
3. Event-based follow-ups (asks about specific things)

**Open question:** Is this enough? Unknown.

## Wedges Explored

### Wedge A: "The friend who actually follows up"
- Hook: "An AI that asks 'how did your interview go?'"
- Strength: Tangible, demonstrable
- Weakness: Hard to convey before experiencing it
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge B: "Daily check-in ritual"
- Hook: "Someone who checks in. Every day."
- Strength: Simple to understand
- Weakness: Journaling apps do this
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge C: "For solo founders"
- Hook: "The cofounder who just listens"
- Strength: Clear ICP, founder understands the pain
- Weakness: Small market
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge D: "For expats / people far from home"
- Hook: "Someone from home. In your timezone."
- Strength: Clear pain point
- Weakness: Fragmented market
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge E: Anti-positioning
- Hook: "Not therapy. Not a chatbot."
- Strength: Memorable
- Weakness: Doesn't say what it IS
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge F: SMS instead of app
- Hook: "A friend who texts you. Literally."
- Strength: No app install friction
- Weakness: Cost, international complexity
- Status: Unexplored with users

### Wedge G: "The aha moment"
- Hook: "The AI that surprises you by remembering"
- Strength: Emotionally powerful
- Weakness: Requires time to experience
- Status: Unexplored with users

## Alternative Directions Explored (Jan 25-26)

### Path 1: "Vanity Route" (User-Centric Reframe)

Shift from "AI that remembers you" to "your memory, externalized."

**Potential hooks:**
- "Your life, remembered. Searchable. Yours."
- "The only app that knows what you worried about 6 months ago."

**Problem:** Competes with journaling apps, PKM tools. What does AI add?

**Status:** Explored conceptually, not validated.

### Path 2: B2B Infrastructure ("Presence Layer")

Sell the judgment layer to other AI products.

**Segments considered:**
- Mental health apps → Regulatory issues
- Coaching apps → Want goal-tracking, not presence
- Elder care → Long sales cycle

**Problem:** "Nice to have" not "must have." Build vs. buy.

**Status:** Explored conceptually, not validated.

## ICP Hypothesis

**Draft persona (unvalidated):**
```
Name: Sarah
Age: 34
Location: Austin, TX
Job: Senior PM at Series B startup
Why lonely: Work consuming. Friends distant. Dating exhausting.
Why current solutions fail: Apps are passive. Therapy is clinical.
What she wants: Someone who reaches out first.
```

**Status:** Hypothesis only. Not tested with real people matching this profile.

---

## Where This Stands

**Conclusion from exploration (Jan 26):**

Neither the wedge frameworks nor the alternative paths produced a clear answer. Multiple sessions of strategic analysis didn't converge on sharpness.

**The uncomfortable truth:** Maybe the wedge isn't in positioning at all. The thread follow-up behavior ("asks how your interview went 3 days later") is the most concrete differentiator. Everything else is framing.

**Current position:** Ship to 10 users. Watch what they respond to. Let the wedge emerge from usage.

- Mapped competitive landscape
- Brainstormed 7 wedges
- Recognized product is built but story isn't sharp

**2026-01-25:**
- Created Sarah persona hypothesis
- Drafted pitch attempts
- Explored Wedge A + E combination

**2026-01-25 (continued):**
- Acknowledged frameworks felt "dull" despite being correct
- Explored vanity route and B2B infrastructure paths
- Neither produced clarity
- Concluded: stop strategizing, start shipping

**2026-01-26:**
- Converted this document from "strategy" to "exploration log"
- Removed false confidence from framing
- See [CURRENT_STATE.md](../CURRENT_STATE.md) for what's actually true

## Open Questions (Unanswered)

1. Does anyone want this product?
2. Is "thread follow-up" the differentiator, or just a feature?
3. Who specifically would pay, and why?
4. What makes someone come back after Day 3?
5. What do users actually say when they describe this to others?

These can only be answered with users.
