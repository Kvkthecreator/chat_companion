# GTM & Distribution Strategy Reset

> **Date**: 2026-01-14
> **Status**: Active - Replacing OI/manhwa targeting
> **Context**: Technical foundation fixed, need intent-matched audience

---

## Executive Summary

**Product is validated. Distribution needs complete reset.**

**Core insight:** We're NOT competing with webtoons or visual novels. We're creating a NEW category: **structured narrative chat experiences**.

**Target audience shift:**
- ❌ **OLD**: OI/manhwa fans (want visual content)
- ✅ **NEW**: Interactive fiction enthusiasts + Character.AI power users

**Goal:** Achieve 40-60% activation rate (vs current 0-25%) by targeting users who already want chat-based stories.

---

## Market Positioning (Revised)

### The Value Proposition

**For users who love Character.AI but want:**
- ✅ Actual story arcs (beginning, middle, end)
- ✅ Narrative structure (not infinite wandering)
- ✅ Curated quality (authored episodes)
- ✅ Visual elements (AI-generated scenes)

**For users who love visual novels but want:**
- ✅ Dynamic conversation (not preset choices)
- ✅ More agency (open-ended responses)
- ✅ Lower cost ($3-5 per series vs $20 per game)
- ✅ Faster content updates (AI-native production)

**For users who love interactive fiction but want:**
- ✅ Conversational interface (not parser commands)
- ✅ Character relationships (emotional connection)
- ✅ Visual elements (not pure text)
- ✅ Romance/genre variety (beyond traditional IF)

### Positioning Statement

**Old (Wrong):**
> "Interactive otome isekai stories — text your way to a new ending"

**New (Correct):**
> "Character.AI meets Netflix: Structured story episodes where your messages shape the plot"

**Alternative frames:**
- "Chat-based visual novels with dynamic conversation"
- "Interactive fiction with AI characters and visual scenes"
- "Episodic romance stories through chat (like texting a character from your favorite show)"

## Channel Strategy

### ❌ **Pause Immediately**

1. **Reddit ads to r/OtomeIsekai** - Wrong audience (0% activation)
2. **Reddit ads to r/manhwa** - Wrong audience (visual media fans)
3. **Any targeting of "webtoon readers"** - Format mismatch

### ✅ **Test This Week (Organic First)**

#### **Test 1: r/CharacterAI Organic Post**

**Post title:**
> "I built structured story episodes for Character.AI fans – looking for beta testers"

**Post body:**
```markdown
Hey everyone! I've been frustrated with Character.AI's lack of story structure,
so I built something different: chat-based stories with actual episode arcs.

**What it is:**
- Chat with AI characters (like Character.AI)
- But in structured story episodes (with beginnings/endings)
- Your messages shape the plot
- AI-generated scene images
- Free Episode 0 for every series

**Example:** Chat with a detective investigating a case (Episode 0 free),
then continue through 6-8 episodes to solve it. Each episode = 10-15 min conversation.

Looking for 10-20 people to try it and give feedback. All episodes free for testers.

[Link to series page]
```

**Success criteria:**
- 20+ comments
- 10+ people actually try it
- 5+ send first message
- 2+ complete Episode 0

**If successful:** Character.AI users ARE the audience.

---

#### **Test 2: r/interactivefiction Organic Post**

**Post title:**
> "Interactive fiction experiment: AI-driven stories with conversational choices"

**Post body:**
```markdown
I've been experimenting with IF using LLMs for dynamic conversation instead
of preset choices.

**How it works:**
- You chat with characters (type anything, not multiple choice)
- Story progresses through structured episodes
- AI generates responses + occasional scene images
- Your messages determine plot direction

Think: Choice of Games meets Character.AI

**Genres:** Romance, mystery, thriller, otome-style

Free Episode 0 for all series. Would love IF community feedback on
whether this feels like "real" interactive fiction or something else.

[Link]
```

**Success criteria:**
- 15+ engaged comments
- 5+ people try it
- Feedback on whether they consider it "IF"

**If successful:** IF readers accept AI chat format.

---

#### **Test 3: TikTok Organic (Video Content)**

**Current issue:** Using static images of characters/series
**Problem:** Doesn't show the chat interface

**New approach:**

**Video 1: "POV: You're texting a character from your favorite story"**
- 0-3s: Hook text "POV: The detective won't stop texting you about the case"
- 3-10s: Screen recording of chat interface
  - Show opening message appearing
  - Show starter prompts
  - Tap one prompt
  - Show character response
- 10-15s: Text overlay "Chat your way through the story" + link in bio

**Video 2: "Character.AI but with actual story structure"**
- 0-3s: "Character.AI users will love this"
- 3-12s: Side-by-side comparison
  - Left: Character.AI (infinite chat)
  - Right: ep-0 (Episode 1 → Episode 8 progression)
- 12-15s: "Stories that actually end" + link

**Video 3: "When the AI character won't let you friendzone them"**
- 0-3s: Relatable hook
- 3-12s: Actual chat conversation (funny/dramatic)
- 12-15s: "Play free Episode 0" + link

**Format:**
- Phone screen recording (vertical 9:16)
- Text overlays for context
- Trending audio
- Hashtags: #CharacterAI #InteractiveFiction #VisualNovel #OtomeGame #AIStorytelling

**Success criteria:**
- 1000+ views per video
- 5+ comments asking for link
- 2+ people actually sign up from TikTok traffic

---

### ✅ **Test Next Week (If Organic Validates)**

#### **Paid Reddit Ads (New Targeting)**

**Campaign 1: r/CharacterAI**

**Creative:**
- Image: Screenshot of chat interface (show message bubbles + prompts)
- Headline: "Character.AI + story structure = actual endings"
- CTA: Reddit default (probably "Learn More" or "Shop Now")

**Body text (if available):**
> "Chat-based stories with episodes. Like Character.AI but your conversations
> have narrative arcs. Free Episode 0 for all series."

**URL:** `ep-0.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=characterai-v1`

**Budget:** $20 test
**Expected CTR:** 0.8-1.2% (higher than OI targeting)
**Expected activation:** 60%+

---

**Campaign 2: r/otomegames** (NOT r/OtomeIsekai)

**Creative:**
- Image: Character portrait + chat UI screenshot (show both)
- Headline: "Otome games but you can type anything"
- CTA: Default

**Body text:**
> "Chat-based otome stories. Type your own responses instead of choosing
> from 3 options. Episode structure like visual novels. Free to start."

**URL:** `ep-0.com/series/villainess-survives?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=otomegames-v1`

**Budget:** $15 test
**Expected activation:** 40-50%

---

**Campaign 3: r/interactivefiction**

**Creative:**
- Image: Text-heavy (show conversation, not character art)
- Headline: "IF meets AI: Stories that respond to anything"
- CTA: Default

**Body text:**
> "Interactive fiction with AI-driven conversation. No parser commands,
> no preset choices. Type what you want to say, story adapts. Episodic structure."

**URL:** `ep-0.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=if-v1`

**Budget:** $15 test
**Expected activation:** 50-60%

---

### ✅ **TikTok Paid Ads (If Organic Works)**

**Only run paid TikTok if organic videos get 1000+ views.**

**Creative format:**
- Use successful organic videos as ad creative
- Target interests: Character.AI, visual novels, interactive fiction, romance books
- Age: 18-34
- Geography: US, Canada, UK

**Budget:** $30 test
**Expected:** Higher volume, lower intent than Reddit

---

## Creative Asset Strategy (Working Within Constraints)

### Reddit Ads

**Constraint:** Can't add text overlay to images (too small on mobile)
**Constraint:** CTA button is pre-defined (can't say "Start Chat")

**Solution: Image + Headline combo**

**Option 1: Chat Interface Screenshot**
- Image: Clean screenshot of chat with 2-3 message bubbles visible
- Shows: Character avatar, message bubbles, starter prompts
- No text overlay needed — image itself shows chat format
- Headline: "Character.AI + story structure"

**Option 2: Split Image**
- Left 40%: Character portrait
- Right 60%: Chat interface screenshot
- Shows both "character" and "chat format"
- Headline: "Chat with [Character Name] in [Genre] story"

**Option 3: Before/After**
- Top half: Character portrait with "Episode 1"
- Bottom half: Same character with "Episode 8"
- Shows progression/episodic structure
- Headline: "8-episode story arc through chat"

**Current assets you have:**
- Character portraits ✅ (use in split image)
- Series cover images ✅ (use as background)
- Need: Chat interface screenshots ❌ (take these from actual app)

---

### TikTok Videos

**Constraint:** Only have static images (characters, series covers)
**Current approach:** Posting static images ❌ (doesn't show format)

**Solution: Screen recordings + existing assets**

**Video template:**
1. **Hook (0-3s):** Text overlay on character image
2. **Demo (3-12s):** Screen recording of chat interface
3. **CTA (12-15s):** Series cover image + "Link in bio"

**You already have:**
- Character images ✅ (use for hook)
- Series cover images ✅ (use for CTA)
- Need: Screen recordings ❌ (record from your own sessions)

**How to create screen recordings:**
1. Use QuickTime (Mac) or built-in screen recorder
2. Open chat interface on mobile simulator OR real phone
3. Record 10-second interaction (opening message → tap prompt → response)
4. Edit in CapCut (free) or iMovie
5. Add text overlays and trending audio

**Time investment:** 30 min per video (worth it vs static images that don't convert)

---

## Success Metrics (Revised)

### Old Metrics (OI/Manhwa Targeting)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Reddit CTR | 0.6-0.9% |
| Signups | 4 (oi-deathflag + manhwa-regressor) |
| Activation | 1 of 4 (25%) |
| Cost per activation | $34.56 |

**Conclusion:** Wrong audience, format mismatch.

---

### New Target Metrics (Character.AI / IF Targeting)

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Reddit CTR | 0.8-1.5% | Higher intent match |
| Organic post engagement | 20+ comments | Validates interest |
| Activation rate | 40-60% | Right expectations set |
| Cost per activation | <$5 | Better targeting |
| Episode 0 completion | 30%+ | Measure engagement depth |

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ If 5+ organic testers activate → Audience validated
- ✅ If activation >40% on paid ads → Channel validated
- ✅ If cost per activation <$10 → Economics viable

**Failure criteria:**
- ❌ If <3 organic testers activate → Still wrong audience
- ❌ If activation <20% on paid ads → Format still misunderstood
- ❌ If cost per activation >$20 → Channel not viable

## 7-Day Action Plan

### Day 1 (Today - Jan 14)

**Morning:**
- [x] Update ADR-000 with new strategic understanding
- [ ] Create 1 chat interface screenshot for ads
- [ ] Record 1 screen recording video (15 sec) for TikTok

**Afternoon:**
- [ ] Post to r/CharacterAI (organic test)
- [ ] Post to r/interactivefiction (organic test)
- [ ] Upload TikTok video #1 ("POV: texting detective")

**Evening:**

- [ ] Check activation rate of organic signups

**Decision point:** If 5+ people activate from organic posts, proceed to paid ads.

---

### Day 4-5 (Jan 17-18)

**If organic validated:**
- [ ] Create Reddit ad campaigns (CharacterAI, otomegames, IF)
- [ ] Budget: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50 total
- [ ] Run for 48 hours

**If organic didn't validate:**
- [ ] User interviews (why didn't they activate?)
- [ ] Revise positioning
- [ ] Test different messaging

---

### Day 6-7 (Jan 19-20)

- [ ] Analyze paid ad performance
- [ ] Calculate activation rate by campaign
- [ ] Measure cost per activated user
- [ ] Document learnings

**Decision criteria:**
```
IF activation rate >40% AND cost per activation <$10:
  → Scale successful campaigns
  → Double budget on winners
  → Create more TikTok content

ELSE IF activation rate 20-40%:
  → Optimize messaging/creative
  → A/B test different hooks
  → Iterate for another week

ELSE IF activation rate <20%:
  → Deeper problem exists
  → Need user interviews
  → Reconsider product/market fit
```

---

## Messaging Framework (By Channel)

### Reddit r/CharacterAI

**Hook:** "Frustrated with Character.AI lately?"
**Value prop:** "What if your chats had actual story structure?"
**Proof:** "8-episode arcs with beginnings, middles, endings"
**CTA:** "Try free Episode 0"

**Avoid:**
- Don't trash Character.AI directly
- Don't claim to be "better" (just different)
- Don't mention "AI" excessively (they already know)

---

### Reddit r/interactivefiction

**Hook:** "IF experiment using LLMs"
**Value prop:** "Conversational choices instead of parser/multiple choice"
**Proof:** "Episodic structure like Choice of Games"
**CTA:** "Would love IF community feedback"

**Avoid:**
- Don't oversell AI capabilities
- Don't claim it's "real IF" (let them decide)
- Don't ignore IF traditions (acknowledge parser/choice heritage)

---

### TikTok

**Hook:** "POV: You're texting [relatable scenario]"
**Value prop:** [Show, don't tell - screen recording]
**Proof:** "Free to try"
**CTA:** "Link in bio"

**Avoid:**
- Don't show static images (need movement)
- Don't use text-heavy explanations (visual medium)
- Don't ignore trending audio/formats

---

## What NOT To Do

### ❌ Don't Resume Old Campaigns

- No more ads to r/OtomeIsekai
- No more ads to r/manhwa
- No more "interactive isekai" positioning

### ❌ Don't Change The Product

- Keep episode structure (it's the moat)
- Keep chat interface (it's the format)
- Keep free Episode 0 (it's the funnel)

### ❌ Don't Over-Optimize Before Validation

- Don't A/B test 10 ad variants
- Don't spend >$50 before finding the right audience
- Don't build new features before activation works

---

## Long-Term Channel Strategy (If Validation Succeeds)

### Month 1: Organic + Small Paid Tests
- Reddit organic posts
- TikTok organic videos
- $50-100/week paid ads to validated channels

### Month 2: Scale What Works
- Double budget on best-performing campaigns
- Create more content for TikTok
- Engage communities (Discord, forums)

### Month 3: Expand Channels
- Twitter/X targeting #CharacterAI
- YouTube shorts (screen recordings)
- Direct partnerships with Character.AI creators
- Sponsorships in IF podcasts/newsletters

### Long-term (6+ months)
- SEO for "character.ai alternative"
- App store optimization (if mobile app)
- Referral program for existing users
- Creator program (user-generated series)
